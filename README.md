sundata parser
==============

Parse files from SunData and output a csv result.

This initial version is written for a specific situation and could be rebuilt for others.

#### A note about tests

Because I don't have permission to publish the data, the test currently fail without the provided fixtures.
I will in the future fake some data in order to provide public fixtures.
If you have data to donate I'll gladly use it too, as long as you're able to provide an Apache license compatible license to distribute the test data.
